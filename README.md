# Risk-Adjusted-Returns-using-Sortino-Ratio
This is a script for calculating risk-adjusted returns using the Sortino Ratio, a popular financial performance metric that takes into account both the return and the downside risk of an investment. The Sortino Ratio is a more robust alternative to the Sharpe Ratio, as it only considers the downside risk rather than the total risk of an investment.
